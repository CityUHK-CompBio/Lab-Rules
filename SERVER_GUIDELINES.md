# Server Guidelines

These guidelines outline the policies and procedures for data and code management, as well as server usage and data protection. All laboratory members and users of our servers are expected to adhere to these rules.

**Server Types Provided:** We offer large-scale clusters, data storage servers, GPU servers, and web servers.

## 1. Data Management

### For PhD Students
- **Data Transfer After Graduation:** All data stored in your personal directory on the servers will, **after your graduation**, be periodically transferred to either a *cold storage hard drive* or a *dedicated data server* (depending on available storage capacity).
- **Backup Responsibility:** You are responsible for proper data management and **must back up any essential data**. The laboratory will not be liable for any data loss that might occur during the transfer process.
- **Contact Information:** If you discover that your data has been transferred, please contact `yhzhang@surgery.cuhk.edu.hk` to retrieve your data.  
  **Note:** Emails sent during weekends may not receive a prompt response and might be overlooked.

### For Master's Students
- **Data Removal Policy:** All data stored in your personal directory on the servers will be completely removed if you cease using the server for a period of six months.  
  **Please ensure that you back up all necessary data and code before this occurs.**

## 2. Code Management

- **Repository Guidelines:** For any code associated with upcoming publications, please create a repository within this organization or fork your personal repository into this organization.
- **Platform Recommendation:** It is strongly recommended that you use GitHub as your code management platform.
- **Privacy Requirements:** **Prior to manuscript submission, the repository should remain private; once the manuscript is submitted, it should be made public.**

## 3. Server Storage Space

- **Storage Allocation:** There are no immediate restrictions on server storage space until capacity nears its limit. When storage becomes constrained, space will be allocated among enrolled students on an equal basis.
- **Maintenance:** **Please ensure that you regularly clean up outdated or redundant backup files.**

## 4. Data Protection

- **Compliance:** When processing and transferring genetic data, please comply with the "Implementation Guidelines for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources."  
- **Security Measures:** Unauthorized data transfers or data breaches will not be tolerated. Any violation will be immediately reported to the police.
- **Mandatory Training:** **Every PhD student is required to complete the relevant data protection training.**
- **Confidentiality:** Data generated by the laboratory is considered confidential. Unauthorized disclosure of internal laboratory data, except where legally mandated, will be referred to the institution's Academic Ethics Committee for further action.

## 5. Other Related Matters

- **Server-Related Issues:** For any other server-related issues, please contact either `xgwang@surgery.cuhk.edu.hk` or `yhzhang@surgery.cuhk.edu.hk`. Both individuals have root privileges on all servers and are responsible for managing the generated data.
- **Alumni Protocol:** Alumni who have graduated should first contact Professor Wang and then reach out to the administrators to discuss their requirements.

## 6. New Student Orientation and Server Usage Responsibilities

- **Mandatory Reading:** **All new students must read this page before requesting the file containing detailed server information from the administrators.**
- **Responsible Use:** **Please make efficient and responsible use of the server's computing resources.** Misuse that results in server downtime will cause significant delays.
- **Downtime Protocol:**
  - **If server misuse leads to downtime:** The administrators will repair the server on the next working day after the outage is detected, potentially delaying work by at least one day.
  - **If the server goes down for unknown reasons and you are unable to SSH:** Do **not** immediately contact the administrators. Please wait for **30 minutes**; if the server does not recover, then report the issue. *Note:* When you cannot SSH, the administrators may also be unable to SSH, and they will address the problem on the next working day.
- **Misuse Reporting:** If you notice any misuse of the server, **please privately remind the individual or alert the group chat** instead of directly contacting the administrators, as they are not always online.
- **Account Security:** **If you compromise the secure use of the server, your account may be banned.**
- **Self-Reliance:** As a basic requirement for PhD students in computational biology, you are expected to learn about server management on your own. **All environment configurations should be managed through your personal conda environments.** If you encounter issues with your environment, you are responsible for resolving them; administrators are not obligated to provide assistance.
- **Escalation Procedure:** For any other issues not covered by these guidelines, please contact Professor Wang first and then reach out to the administrator.
